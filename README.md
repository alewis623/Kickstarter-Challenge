# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Analysis of Campaigns in Relation to Launch Dates and Funding Goals
---
### Purpose
_"Fever"_ came close to the fundraising goal in a narrow time period. This project is to analize how historical theater campaigns data, will relate the outcome to the launch date and its funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
There are 2 areas of focus from the analysis of the Kickstarter data set. Those focus areas are outlined below.  
* The first analysis focused on the outcomes based on the launch date.
* The final analysis was around outcomes based on the amount of the goal established.

There were few challenges in the analytics of the data. Challenges could have resulted from the distribution of the data being more consistant. This would make determining a conclusion more challenging. There are some limitations in the data set. There are no canceled projects that are seen in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Reviewing the analysis of launch date the best time to launch a kickstarter would be late spring/ early summer.
The specific recomendation would be to launch in May or June. as the year progresses, the success of the outcomes reduces. 
The launch month with the highest failure rate is October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Reviewing the outcomes based on funding goals the most successful campaigns have a funding goal below $1000 to as high as $5,000. 
These funding goals have the highest total number of projects. There is an area between $35000 and $45000 that is also a successful funding goal. 
The $35000 to $45000 range has a very low number of projects (less than 1% of total)and does not follow the trending pattern of decline 
in success that is seen as the funding goal increases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges in this particular project envolved the moving the analysis to GitHub. I was unable to independedly establish the SSH key.
Additional analysis could be performed on the impact of the genre of the play and what impact that would have on the overall conclusion.
