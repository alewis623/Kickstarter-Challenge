# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Analysis of Campaigns in Relation to Launch Dates and Funding Goals
---
## Purpose
_"Fever"_ came close to the fundraising goal in a narrow time period. This project is to analyze how historical theater campaigns data, will relate the outcome to the launch date and its funding goal.
---
## Analysis and Challenges
---
The following areas of the kickstarter data set was analyzed this project.
* The worksheet tab Years, filters the Category to Theater and allows the viewer to select a year, range of years, or include all years. Outcomes that are successful, failed or canceled are filtered. 
* The worksheet tab, Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, shows a graphical view of the the data in the Years worksheet. The user can filter directly from this privot chart. 
* The final tab, Outcomes based on Goals shows both a pivot of the kickstarter data set and a pivot chart demonstrating the change in successful, failed or canceled projects in fundraising goal categories. 
The total kickstarter data set included 4114 data rows. Due to outliers in the data, the distribution is broader in scope and therefore can be challenging to make concusions in some aspects. There are some limitations in the data stemming from missin canceled projects in October. Further investigation should take place to determine if there is data missing or if by circumstance there were no cancelations during the month of October in theater from 2009-2017. Additional Analytics could be performed reviewing genre, and country as well as addtional analysis of outliers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In reviewing the analysis of launch date, the best time to launch a kickstarter would be late spring/ early summer. 
The specific recomendation would be to launch in May or June. as the year progresses, the success of the outcomes reduces. 
The launch month with the highest failure rate is October. This is represented in the chart below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---
Reviewing the outcomes based on funding goals, the most successful campaigns have a funding goal below $1000 to as high as $5,000. 
These funding goals have the highest total number of projects. There is an area between $35000 and $45000 that is also a successful funding goal percentage. 
The $35000 to $45000 range has a very low number of projects (less than 1% of total)and does not follow the trending pattern of decline 
in success that is seen as the funding goal increases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered.
---
I was well prepared for the analysis of this data by my experiance, the instructers, the inclass moduals and the assistance of the teaching assistants. The largest challenge I faced in this project was working with and understanding GitHub, Git Bash and the manipulation of these programs to get the data loaded has taken the bulk of the study time attached to this project.
